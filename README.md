#Description

This micro-project demonstrates an Android application architecture that processes car location data and presents relevant Points of Interest (POIs) such as restaurants or charging stations. The focus is on backend logic and architecture rather than UI. The application uses Clean Architecture, Kotlin, and an extendable filtering strategy to support different car models.
